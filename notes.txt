Installing the dependencies:
- axios => for making API requests
- moment => for time and dates
- react-file-base64 => To convert images
- redux
- redux-thunk => for async actions using redux

For Server side:
use the command to initialize the an empty package.json:
> npm init -y

Installing the dependencies:
- body-parser => To enable us to send post requests
- cors => To enable cross-origin requests
- express => Express framework for routing of the application
- mongoose => MongoDB modules for our posts

* Earlier we used to import like:
> const express = require('express');
But with the newer versions of node we can use the following:
> import express from 'express';
(but with the help of a single modification in the package.json)
